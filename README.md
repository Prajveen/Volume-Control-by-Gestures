# Volume-Control-by-Gestures


This project utilizes computer vision and hand gesture recognition to control system volume. It captures video from a webcam, detects hand gestures, and interprets specific hand movements to adjust the volume. The system calculates the distance between critical landmarks on the hand, such as the thumb and index finger, to determine the desired volume level. By interpreting hand movements, the system adjusts the volume accordingly, providing users with a hands-free method to control audio output levels.
